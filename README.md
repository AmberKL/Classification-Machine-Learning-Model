# Classification-Machine-Learning-Model

I've been studying Machine Learning for a month or so now, and have finally felt confident enough to select a dataset online to practice
a classification model as defined below.

Predicting Heart Disease Using Machine Learning
Using various Python based ML and Data Science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting
whether or not someone has heart disease, based on their medical attributes (from UCI heart-disease-dataset)

Approach Framework:
- Problem Definition
- Data
- Evaluation
- Features
- Modelling
- Experimentation

Problem Definition
Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?

Data Dictionary
Data is sourced from UCI Heart Disease - Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/redwankarimsony/heart-disease-data

Evaluation
If we can reach >95% accuracy at predicitng whether or not a patient has heart disease during proof of concept, pursue the project
